# Link Shortener

In order to launch backend, create .env file in root directory and put 

```env
MODE= dev || prod
MONGO_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017
```

>Production option in mode, launches the API with cors turned on, with http://localhost:3000 linked with it
>> Development mode on the other hand, turnes it off for testing
